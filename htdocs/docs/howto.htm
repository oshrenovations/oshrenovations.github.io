		<p><h2>How To Use the Prairie Railing Content Manager</h2></p>
<p>Author: Keith Mastin<br>January 18, 2010</p>

<p>Open your website to the content management function. (http://www.prairierailing.com/edit)</p>

<p><ul>There are basically 3 things you can do with your Content Manager:<br>
<li>	1) Edit your webpage content;</li>
<li>	2) Add or edit images for use in your webpages; and</li>
<li>	3) Back-up your website content into a .zip file in case you make an error and foo-bar something important.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><ul><li>ToDo:</li>
<li>*_Now_*</li>
<li>- Edit Content Manager Pages. Disable Functions That They wont be able to use. specifically Add New Blocks. Do this by commenting out the 'create blocks' line in index.php</li>
<li>- Create a Gallery Page and Insert it into the menu.</li>
<li>- Create Images folder to store images that are not to be removed in any event</li>
</ul></p>

<p><ul><li>*_After Loading Current Website_* </li>
<li>- Prepare a content template with block address for each page.</li>
<li>- Replace current pages with content manager edited pages.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>You will find there a list of content blocks. Each Block represents the content of each one of your web pages.</p>

<p>Select the page you wish to edit and double-click on it.</p>

<p>Here you can easily add or change text on your webpage by using the WYSIWYG content manager. Images can also be added, but there are steps to take first.</p>

<p>To add or change images, you must first go into the image manager. Here you may either add new images to use in your website or add existing images to a webpage.</p>

<p>To add an image for use in your website, it must be less than 100KB and in either .jpg, .gif or .png format, and it must already be on the computer you are currently using. Simply click on the "+ Upload New" icon and browse your computer for the image you wish to add to your website.</p>

<p>Once the image is loaded here, you may use it by right-clicking and copy'ing the address of the image. Then go to the "Content Blocks" page and choose the page you wish to add the image to. Place your cursor in the spot you wish to add the image, and then click on the "image" icon. Here you can paste the address of the image into the form in the URL slot.</p>

<p>You can then adjust the size of the image, align it to either the left or right side of the page as you wish. The "Alternative Text" field is to be filled with a very brief description of the image should it not appear on the webpage (some browsers do not show images).</p>

<p>After editing the content block of your webpage, you must save your work (hit the "save" button) in order for your changes to take effect.</p>

<p>*_Creating an Image Gallery_*<br>
In the image manager you may also create a gallery of all the images you have and they can be all seen on one page in thumbnails. However, this is more difficult as it requires adding the gallery URL being added directly into the page template.</p>
