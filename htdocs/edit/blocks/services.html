This outlet was in a garage where there was wood-working being done as a hobby. Very fine, airborne sawdust crept into and settled in the electrical outlet boxes. One spark... The fix was quick and low-cost, and prevents this fire hazard from happening again.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
A lot of the electrical work entails fixing the past mistakes of others who should have probably not attempted home wiring projects without more information, post-inspection, or both. Just because it works doesn't mean it's safe. Correcting these issues is expensive. Not correcting them is even more expensive.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Insurance companies will look for reasons to deny your claim. Faulty wiring is not necessarily covered, and could be used to deny your claim altogether. If wiring is done according to code, <i>or better,</i> then electrial never becomes an insurance issue. Win / win situation.
